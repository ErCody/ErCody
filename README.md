## Hello there, I'm [ErcodY!](https://github.com/ErCody)<img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32" /></h1>
My name is Ergun and I am 17 years old. Since the age of 11 I have been fond of IT and already have advanced knowledge of programming. The impetus for developing my skills was StepIT.

I have participated in many competitions and events such as iSTEM, Teknofest and Google Hash Code. I have experience working as part of a team and individually. A sober assessment of the situation and finding the most optimal solution to the problem is also part of my skills.

Now I position myself as a .NET software developer.
